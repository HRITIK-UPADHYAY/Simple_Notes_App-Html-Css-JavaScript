# Simple_Notes_App-Html-Css-JavaScript
I developed a notes application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the localStorage API for data
storage. This project allowed users to create, edit, and delete notes directly in the web browser,
providing a convenient way to keep track of important information.
